<h2>WIN FINTECH</h2>
<h3>About Me:</h3>
<p><b>My name is Simenesh Abebe and I am in the WIN Fintech program. I previously worked as a CNA at Novant Health
    for over 20 years. I enjoyed my job as a CNA, but want to enrich my knowledge within the technology world. This is why
    I signed up for this program. I love learning new things and constantly being immersed in new information, and I am excited for 
    how this program will impact me and my family. I was born in Ethiopia, and came to United States, with my husband, at the age of 23.
    I have a son that is 15 years old and a daughter that is 21 years old. Below is a picture of us together:
